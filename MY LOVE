<h1 style="color:Red">Love. Love is what I felt at the first sight. I wanted a bite. His body small yet so beautiful. Every bit of my being resisted to run up and kiss him.</h1>
<p style="color:Green">He was a child. I waited. And waited. He never aged. My heart was cracking by the second. About to collapse. Love dwindling. The Shiny Constance was there. I wanted to love him. But after a certian time. I couldn't. No. No. No. No. No. No more. I couldn't anymore.</p>
<p style="color:Blue">LOVE, LOVE IS WHAT I WANTED FOR HIM [NEVER COULD].</p>
<p>ALL I WANTED [HATED] WAS HIM TO LOVE ME BACK AND AGE TO A REASONABLE TIME [LIAR] BUT HE WOULDN'T HE SPENT 18 YEARS A CHILD [LIE] I MISS HIM. SOON ALL MY LOVE [HATE] TURNED TO HATE [HATE]. HATE IS WHAT I HAD LEFT. </p>
